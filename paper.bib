	abstract = {Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse  models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the  latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed  for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML  Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to  representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with  features suited to other model types including constraint-based models,  reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The  format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that  transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently,  the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources  such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of  integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges  presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation  needed to support this evolution.},
