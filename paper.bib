To reproduce simulation results and reuse  models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the  latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed  for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML  Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to  representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with  features suited to other model types including constraint-based models,  reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The  format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that  transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently,  the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources  such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of  integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges  presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation  needed to support this evolution.},

ABSTRACT={The issue of reproducibility of computational models and the related FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) are examined in a specific test case. I analyze a computational model of the segment polarity network in Drosophila embryos published in 2000. Despite the high number of citations to this publication, 23 years later the model is barely accessible, and consequently not interoperable. Following the text of the original publication allowed successfully encoding the model for the open source software COPASI. Subsequently saving the model in the SBML format allowed it to be reused in other open source software packages. Submission of this SBML encoding of the model to the BioModels database enables its findability and accessibility. This demonstrates how the FAIR principles can be successfully enabled by using open source software, widely adopted standards, and public repositories, facilitating reproducibility and reuse of computational cell biology models that will outlive the specific software used.}

abstract = {Background and scope
Differential equation systems modeling biochemical reaction networks can only give quantitative predictions, when they are in accordance with experimental data. However, even if a model can well recapitulate given data, it is often the case that some of its kinetic parameters can be arbitrarily chosen without significantly affecting the simulation results. This indicates a lack of appropriate data to determine those parameters. In this case, the parameter is called to be practically non-identifiable. Well-identified parameters are paramount for reliable quantitative predictions and, therefore, identifiability analysis is an important topic in modeling of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we describe a hidden feature of the free modeling software COPASI, which can be exploited to easily and quickly conduct a parameter identifiability analysis of differential equation systems by calculating likelihood profiles. The proposed combination of an established method for parameter identifiability analysis with the user-friendly features of COPASI offers an easy and rapid access to parameter identifiability analysis even for non-experts.
